## Á∫ßËÅî (Cascade)

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

The "Cascade" in CSS applies rules from **top to bottom**.

## ÁâπÂºÇÊÄß (Specificity)

Specificity determines, **which rule** is applied by the browsers.

---

Specificity is usually the reason why your CSS-rules don‚Äôt apply to some elements, although you think they should.

---

If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with **higher specificity** wins.
